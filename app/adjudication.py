"""Pure adjudication rules for radio applications.

An application grants:

* a coverage **circle** in planar coordinates ``(cx, cy, r)``;
* a **closed** frequency interval ``[freq_low, freq_high]``;
* a **half-open** UTC time interval ``[start_time, end_time)``.

Two *effective* (approved and not later revoked) applications interfere iff
ALL of the following hold:

1. the time intervals intersect;
2. the coverage circles intersect;
3. the closed frequency bands intersect, OR the minimum gap between them is
   strictly smaller than the non-negative guard band.

The module is free of framework / database code so the rules can be unit
tested directly.
